[TODO:MonthConversion.java; Enhance the convertMonthWithNestedIf and convertMonthWithSwitch method to match with test cases TestMonthConversion.java on covering various input scenarios and edge cases.]

### Problem Description

Write a Java program to convert month number to month name with different approaches of branching logic on nested if and switch statement; enhance the test cases with addition test method for convertMonthWithNestedIf

### Setup command

N/A

### Run command on Terminal Window

```bash
gradle test
```

### Notes

The JDK is installed on GitHub Actions machines, so you're also able to directly invoke javac, java, or any other CLI command included in the JDK.

After `gradle test`, regardless of test cases pass/fail result, the class files should be available under the build folder. To run the main method of Investment class, issue the following command on the terminal:

```bash
java -cp build/classes/java/main edu.pasadena.cs.cs03b.MonthConversion
```
